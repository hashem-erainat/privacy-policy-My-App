Privacy Policy
Last Updated: February 20, 2026

Welcome to Financial Assistant AI. We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring the security of your personal and financial data. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect information when you use our application.

1. Overview
"Financial Assistant AI" is an expense and debt management application that operates primarily locally (Offline-first) on your device. This means your financial data remains stored on your phone. However, the app utilizes advanced Artificial Intelligence (AI) services from third-party providers for certain features, which require real-time processing via a secure internet connection.

2. Information We Collect and How We Use It
A. Financial Data (Expenses and Debts)
Data Collected: Details you enter manually (amount, category, title, date).
Purpose: To organize your expenses and display statistics and charts.
Storage: This data is stored in a private local database (SQLite/Drift) inside your device. We do not store this data on our own servers.
B. Text and Voice Commands (AI Features)
Service Provider: Google LLC (Gemini AI API).
Mechanism: When you use the "Voice Record" or "Scan Receipt" features, the text (or text converted from audio/images) is transmitted securely to Google’s servers for real-time analysis.
User Permission: The app will obtain your explicit consent through a clear disclosure dialog before sharing any data with the third-party AI service. You can enable or disable AI features at any time through the app settings.
Privacy & Protection: Data is sent solely for processing and extracting transaction details. We confirm that our third-party AI provider (Google LLC) provides the same or equal protection of your personal data as set forth in this policy. This data is used for real-time processing and is not used to train generative AI models.
C. Images (Camera)
Usage: The app requests access to the camera to scan receipts and extract text (OCR) for your convenience.
Processing: Images are used only to extract text and are not stored or shared outside of the necessary processing for expense extraction.
3. Permissions
The application requests the following permissions to function correctly:

Internet: To communicate with secure AI services for data analysis.
Microphone: To record voice commands for expense entry.
Camera: To capture images of receipts for automatic scanning.
4. Data Sharing with Third Parties
We do not sell, rent, or trade your personal data. Limited data is only shared with necessary service providers for the application's core functions:

Google LLC (Gemini AI & Speech-to-Text): For data analysis, extraction, and voice-to-text conversion. We ensure that any third-party service providers we share data with provide the same or equal protection of user data as described in this privacy policy.
5. Data Security
Since your data is primarily stored locally, its security depends on your device's security. We recommend using device passcodes/biometrics to ensure the confidentiality of your financial data. All transmissions to third-party services are encrypted via HTTPS.

6. Your Rights and Data Deletion
You have full control over your data. You can delete all your stored information at any time by:

Using the "Clear Expenses" option within the app settings.
Uninstalling the application from your device, which automatically deletes the local database.
