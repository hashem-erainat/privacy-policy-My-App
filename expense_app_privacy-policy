Privacy Policy
Last Updated: February 18, 2026

Welcome to Financial Assistant AI. We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring the security of your personal and financial data. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect information when you use our application.

1. Overview
"Financial Assistant AI" is an expense and debt management application that operates primarily locally (Offline-first) on your device. This means your financial data remains stored on your phone. However, the app utilizes advanced Artificial Intelligence (AI) services for certain features, which require real-time processing via an internet connection.

2. Information We Collect and How We Use It
A. Financial Data (Expenses and Debts)
Data Collected: Details you enter manually or via voice (amount, category, title, date).
Purpose: To organize your expenses and display statistics and charts.
Storage: This data is stored in a local database (SQLite/Drift) inside your phone. We do not store this data on our own servers.
B. Text and Voice Commands (AI Features)
Service Provider: Google Gemini API.
Mechanism: When you use the "Smart Voice Add" or AI assistant features, the text (or text converted from audio) is transmitted to Google’s servers for real-time analysis.
User Consent: The app will obtain your explicit permission before sending any data to the AI service for the first time. You can enable or disable this feature at any time through the app settings.
Privacy Assurance: Data is sent solely for processing and extracting transaction details. Based on our enterprise API configuration, this data is used for real-time processing and is not used by the provider to train their generative AI models.
C. Images (Camera and Gallery)
Usage: If available, the app may request access to the camera or gallery to scan receipts and extract text (OCR).
Processing: Images are processed either on-device or via secure cloud-based APIs for text extraction purposes only.
3. Permissions
The application requests the following permissions to function correctly:

Internet: To communicate with AI services and check for updates.
Microphone: To record voice commands and convert them to text.
Camera: To capture images of receipts.
Storage/Media: To save generated reports or access receipt images.
4. Data Sharing with Third Parties
We do not sell, rent, or trade your personal data. Limited data is only shared with necessary service providers for the application's core functions:

Google (Gemini AI & Speech-to-Text): For data analysis, extraction, and voice-to-text conversion.
5. Data Security
Since your data is stored locally, its security depends on your device's overall security. We recommend using device passcodes/biometrics and avoiding sharing your device with unauthorized users to ensure the confidentiality of your financial data.

6. Your Rights and Data Deletion
You have full control over your data. You can delete all your stored information at any time by:

Using the "Clear Data" or "Wipe All Data" option within the app settings.
Uninstalling the application from your device, which automatically removes the local database.
